This application was made as a learning exercise in app development in order to learn kivy and also improve python, it took me around a month with few hours a day.
This app is based on webscraping the https://www.bnr.ro/Home.aspx (Romanian National Bank website).
It's intended only for romanian use, as the exchange is based on romanian currency (RON),that's why romania is the only language.
For the app I used the following python libraries: 
urllib3,matplotlib,kivmob,numpy,re,csv,webbrowser.
If you plan to run on desktop(LINUX or Windows) you'll need python3, kivy and the rest of libraries that are stated in main.py.
Also you'll need to extract the zip files in the same folder as main.py.
